Hi, I'm Braindi!

I am a Full Stack Developer with strong skills in both Front-End and Back-End technologies.
During my hands-on experience at Extra Tech, I developed end-to-end solutions using Node.js, React, and MongoDB.
I collaborated with a team to build a comprehensive business management system, covering inventory, customer, and order management.
The project also involved Docker, Redux, and TypeScript.

During my studies, I developed several projects, including:

Course Recommendation System – A C# project designed to recommend courses based on user responses to questions.
The project follows a three-layer architecture, implements Dependency Injection (DI), and integrates JavaScript for front-end interactivity.
E-commerce Website – Built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB. The project utilizes Redux for state management and React Hooks for dynamic component behavior.
"Sherlock" Puzzle Game – Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Food Sales Website – Developed with HTML and CSS, featuring responsive design.
System Analysis for "Mashkar" – Conducted needs analysis, system planning, and design.
I am passionate about coding, a fast learner, and detail-oriented.
I thrive in collaborative environments and constantly seek to expand my skills and contribute to impactful projects.
